# DAO Tokenomics Toolkit
A starter to help DAOs architect the Tokenomics for their community.

## Tokenomics

The objective of a tokenomics program is to establish a compelling market offering with a clear vision statement, espousing the values of blockchain based communities. Considering the questions below, you may produce a tokenomics chart and/or a whitepaper describing the incentives for specific communities to take part in such a community.

> "Token design is an intricate mixture of incentive mechanism design, economics, finance, game theory, software and complex system design, all of which need to be observed and iterated cautiously." -Javi
